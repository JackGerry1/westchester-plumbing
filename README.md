# BTU Calculator

This is a Python script that calculates the British Thermal Units (BTUs) for a room based on its dimensions and other factors.

I originally created a similar but worse GUI program, with horrible if statements, this is a new more refined CLI version

## Getting Started

To run the BTU calculator, make sure you have Python installed on your system. Then, follow these steps:

1. Clone this repository to your local machine.
2. Open a terminal or command prompt and navigate to the cloned repository folder.
3. Run the script by executing the following command:

```bash
python btu_calculator.py
